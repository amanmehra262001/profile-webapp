            Iâ€™m a Blockchain Developer located in India. I have a serious
            passion for programming, especially for development on Web3 as well
            as Game Development. <br />
            <br />
            Result oriented, cheerful, positive person with leadership
            qualities. Always tending to learn and grow even more. Hitting the
            gym makes me who I am, more focused toward my goals. A family person
            and son of a beautiful couple. <br /> <br />
            Interested in the entire Web3 spectrum and working on ambitious
            projects with positive people. <br /> <br />
            Fueled by high energy levels and boundless enthusiasm, I'm easily
            inspired and more then willing to follow my fascinations wherever
            they take me. My abundant energy fuels me in the pursuit of many
            interests, hobbies, areas of study and artistic endeavors. I'm a
            fast learner, able to pick up new skills and juggle different
            projects and roles with relative ease.
